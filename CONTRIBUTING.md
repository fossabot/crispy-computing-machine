## How to report a bug

This is a lab. Let me know if you spot a bug.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

 1. What version of Python/Ansible/Terraform/Docker/Node are you using?
 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
 3. What did you do?
 4. What did you expect to see?
 5. What did you see instead?

## Code review process

I'll review PRs as they come in.
